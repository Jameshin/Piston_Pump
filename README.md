# Piston_Pump
Numerical Simulations of Cylinder Chamber and Sliding Parts in a Swash-Plate Type Piston Pump
1) Ripple : Pressure ripple(pulsation) in the cylinder chamber
2) VB : Sliding part between Valve plate and Barrel
3) PC : Sliding part between Piston and Cylinder
4) WS : Swash-Plate and Slipper
